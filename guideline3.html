                    <p>
                        To maximise accessibility and inclusivity in online
                        course assessments, instructors should design
                        assignments that cater to diverse learner needs and
                        preferences. One key strategy is to create assignments
                        based on real-life scenarios, which helps students apply
                        their learning in meaningful and practical contexts,
                        making the material more relevant to their lives.

                    <p>
                        Embracing diverse submission formats allows students to
                        choose how they demonstrate their understanding, whether
                        through written reports, videos, presentations, or
                        creative projects. This flexibility supports different
                        communication styles and learning preferences, ensuring
                        that all students can express their knowledge
                        effectively.

                    <p>
                        Students feel empowered when they can choose how to

                        and helping students improve their skills.

                    <p>
                        Real-life scenarios require students to apply
                        theoretical knowledge in practical contexts, enhancing
                        their analytical and problem-solving abilities.

                        By expressing their understanding through different

                        perspectives into assignments, the course becomes more
                        inclusive and reflective of a diverse student body.

                        <strong>Start Small and Scale Gradually:</strong> Begin
                        by incorporating a few diverse assignment options or
                        real-life scenarios into your assessments. As you become
                        more comfortable and gather feedback, gradually expand
                        these offerings to cover more course content.

                        various submission formats. This ensures fairness and
                        clarity in assessment, helping students understand

                        different submission formats. Platforms like Learning
                        Management Systems (LMS) often have built-in features
                        that support varied assignment types. Familiarise

                        submission formats to a manageable few and provide
                        guidelines or examples for each to help students make
